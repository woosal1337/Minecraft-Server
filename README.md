# Minecraft-Server
All premade Minecraft server.
Deploying the server is so easy, and made especially to play with friends.

Deploying:
I have personally deployed and tested the server in my VPS and let it run for days, and did not really face any issues.
If you would like to change the amount of the RAM, it should be also specified in the .bat file, where by channging the 2048, 4096 to any (RAM amount * 1024) you want. (More RAM is for smoother performance and gameplay)

No other settings really need to be changed.

After all done, just run the .bat file and do not close anything as closing any of the files will cause a general server damage, not saving the logs, and not a working/online server anymore.

If you want to close the server in a correct way, either use Ctrl+C in the CMD, or just use the Minecraft own released API commands, which you can find all here: https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/minecraft-console-commands-and-cheats,
https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/CraftBukkit_Commands,
https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Admin_and_Server_Commands


Next time you run the server, do the same tasks starting with the .bat file, and letting the last time savings load, you will be ready to go!

GLHF!
